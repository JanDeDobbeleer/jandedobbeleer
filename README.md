### Nice to meet you! ðŸ‘‹

Originally, I started out as a watchmaker but transitioned into software development to pursue a passion I had growing up. The baby steps I took as a WindowsPhone developer moved me into interesting positions as app developer, Team lead all the way to managing more people and teams. In 2016 I created a prompt utility for my own needs as the only Windows developer between Unix aficionados which to this day brings joy to a lot of terminals around the world.
