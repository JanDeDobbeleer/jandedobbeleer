### Nice to meet you! ðŸ‘‹

CTO, [Microsoft MVP](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/PublicProfile/5004199?fullName=Jan%20%20De%20Dobbeleer), [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/invite/nQmDPR9D) Ambassador and creator/maintainer of [oh-my-posh](https://github.com/JanDeDobbeleer/oh-my-posh), a prompt theming engine for Powershell and beyond.

Originally, I started out as a watchmaker but transitioned into software development to pursue a passion I had growing up. The baby steps I took as a WindowsPhone developer moved me into interesting positions as app developer, Team lead all the way to managing more people and teams. In 2016 I created a prompt utility for my own needs as the only Windows developer between Unix aficionados which to this day brings joy to a lot of terminals around the world.

Currently aspiring to become a [GitHub Star ](https://stars.github.com/nominate/) ðŸ˜‰
